- 👋 Hi, I’m @jjsalcedo01
- 👀 I’m interested in credit risk profiling, financial analysis and incorporating non traditional ways of measuring default propensity of firms based on behaviour and qualitative data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub as one of my teammates has spoken so highly of this platform. I currently code in STATA but I do hope to make some time to learn Python. More generally, I'd love to take some classes in law regarding financial services.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything worthwile! :D
- 📫 Reach to me through twitter at jjsalcedo01
